# Slider Game

A silly little puzzle game for mobile/web where I can practice Flutter 
development.

## How to Play

Swipe up, down, left, or right to move a number into the empty space on the 
grid. Try to un-shuffle the numbers by putting them back in numeric order (left 
to right, top to bottom, increasing) in the minimal amount of moves!

## Features

- A sliding number puzzle
- Dark mode
